# MotifDiv

MotifDiv is a dataset of conformational-specificity design challenges from the PDB. It consists of 200 pairs of single-domain proteins with high structural homology, except for a 10-residue motif with high structural divergence. It is suited for the evaluation of methods to design protein sequences with high conformational specificity.
